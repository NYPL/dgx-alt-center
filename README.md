NYPL Alt Center

For one source of Alt for component and app Stores and Actions.

This simple creates one instance of Alt that can be used for an app that uses modules that themselves use Alt. That way, the app will only have one instance of Alt that holds all the Stores and Actions. This is great for isomorphic rendering.
